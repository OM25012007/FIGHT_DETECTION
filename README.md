#  Fight Scene Detection using CLIP and PyTorch

This project demonstrates a basic image classification using the CLIP model to detect whether an image represents a **fight scene** or a **peaceful scene**. It uses PyTorch, `open_clip_torch`, and OpenCV in a Google Colab environment.

---

##  Overview

The script analyzes an input image and compares it with two text prompts:

- `"A fight scene"`
- `"A peaceful scene"`

The CLIP model then determines which of the two is more similar to the image and prints the result.
